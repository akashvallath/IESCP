It's a platform to connect Sponsors and Influencers so that sponsors can get their 
product/service advertised and influencers can get monetary benefit.

# NOTE

For this Application I have used flask framework to create the backend of the application. 
The Frontend is purely made through HTML, and CSS. Only a very small amount of JavaScript has 
been used in the project. No Asynchronous function are used anywhere. Every request has to go 
to the Flask backend server, which then renders the appropriate content back to the browser after 
performing s all calculations and interactions with the database.

# Technologies Used 

- Flask : Backend Framework for building the application -
-  SQL-ALCHEMY : ORM(object-Relational-Mapping) tool for database Interaction 
- SQLite : Database Management system for storing Application Data

  used Bootstrap for styling.
